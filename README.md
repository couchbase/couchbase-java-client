# Official Couchbase Java SDK

**NOTE: This repository contains the 2.x SDK series, which is currently in maintenance mode. We recommend that you check out our 3.x series, which can be found here: https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-jvm-clients**

This project is the official driver for Couchbase when working with Java (or on the JVM). It provides management, CRUD and query facilities through both asynchronous and synchronous APIs.

## Features ##

* High-Performance Key/Value and Query (N1QL, Views, Search, Analytics) operations
* Cluster-Awareness and automatic rebalance and failover handling
* Asynchronous (through [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava)) and Synchronous APIs
* Transparent Encryption Support
* Cluster and Bucket level management facilities
* Complete non-blocking stack through [RxJava](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) and [Netty](http://netty.io)

## Getting Help ##
This README, as well as the [reference documentation](https://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/5.0/sdk/java/start-using-sdk.html) are the best places to get started and dig deeper into the Couchbase SDK. In addition, you might want to look at our [travel-sample application](https://github.com/couchbaselabs/try-cb-java).

The primary way to ask questions is through our official [Forums](http://forums.couchbase.com), although there is also a [stackoverflow tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/couchbase). You can also ask questions on `#couchbase` or `#libcouchbase` on IRC (freenode). Please file any issues you find or enhancements you want to request against our [JIRA](http://issues.couchbase.com/browse/JCBC) which we use for universal issue tracking.

## Quick Start ##
The easiest way is to download the jar as well as its transitive dependencies (only 2) through maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.couchbase.client</groupId>
    <artifactId>java-client</artifactId>
    <version>2.7.22</version>
</dependency>
```

You can find information to older versions as well as alternative downloads [here](http://developer.couchbase.com/server/other-products/release-notes-archives/java-sdk).

The following code connects to the `Cluster`, opens a `Bucket`, stores a `Document`, retrieves it and prints out parts of the content.

```java
// Create a cluster reference
CouchbaseCluster cluster = CouchbaseCluster.create("127.0.0.1");

// Connect to the bucket and open it
Bucket bucket = cluster.openBucket("default");

// Create a JSON document and store it with the ID "helloworld"
JsonObject content = JsonObject.create().put("hello", "world");
JsonDocument inserted = bucket.upsert(JsonDocument.create("helloworld", content));

// Read the document and print the "hello" field
JsonDocument found = bucket.get("helloworld");
System.out.println("Couchbase is the best database in the " + found.content().getString("hello"));

// Close all buckets and disconnect
cluster.disconnect();
```

If you want to perform a N1QL query against [Couchbase Server 4.0](http://www.couchbase.com/nosql-databases/couchbase-server) or later, you can do it like this:

```java
N1qlQueryResult result = bucket.query(N1qlQuery.simple("SELECT DISTINCT(country) FROM `travel-sample` WHERE type = 'airline' LIMIT 10"));

for (N1qlQueryRow row : result) {
    System.out.println(row.value());
}
```

This prints out the distinct countries for all airlines stored in the `travel-sample` bucket that comes with the server.
