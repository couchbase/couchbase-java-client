     * looks like. A separate {@link AsyncBucket#get(Document)} call needs to be issued in order to get the full
     * current content.
     *
     * If the {@link Document} does not exist, it needs to be created upfront. Note that {@link JsonDocument}s in all
     * forms are not supported, it is advised that the following ones are used:
     *
     * - {@link LegacyDocument}
     * - {@link StringDocument}

     * The returned {@link Observable} can error under the following conditions:
     *
     * - The producer outpaces the SDK: {@link BackpressureException}
     * - The operation had to be cancelled while on the wire or the retry strategy cancelled it instead of
     *   retrying: {@link RequestCancelledException}
     * - The request content is too big: {@link RequestTooBigException}
     * - If the document does not exist: {@link DocumentDoesNotExistException}
     * - The server is currently not able to process the request, retrying may help: {@link TemporaryFailureException}
     * - The server is out of memory: {@link CouchbaseOutOfMemoryException}
     * - The durability constraint could not be fulfilled because of a temporary or persistent problem:
     *   {@link DurabilityException}.
     * - Unexpected errors are caught and contained in a generic {@link CouchbaseException}.
     *
     * A {@link DurabilityException} typically happens if the given amount of replicas needed to fulfill the durability
     * constraint cannot be met because either the bucket does not have enough replicas configured or they are not
     * available in a failover event. As an example, if one replica is configured and {@link ReplicateTo#TWO} is used,
     * the observable is errored with a  {@link DurabilityException}. The same can happen if one replica is configured,
     * but one node has been failed over and not yet rebalanced (hence, on a subset of the partitions there is no
     * replica available). **It is important to understand that the original prepend has already happened, so the actual
     * prepend and the watching for durability constraints are two separate tasks internally.**
