   * otherwise an exception is raised. There are many reasons why this could

   *
   * - The given replication settings are invalid.
   * - The operation could not be completed within the timeout.
   * - Something goes wrong and a cluster failover is triggered.
   *
   * The client does not attempt to guarantee the given durability
   * constraints, it just reports whether the operation has been completed
   * or not. If it is not achieved, it is the responsibility of the
   * application code using this API to re-retrieve the items to verify
   * desired state, redo the operation or both.
   *
   * Note that even if an exception during the observation is raised,
   * this doesn't mean that the operation has failed. A normal asyncCAS()
   * operation is initiated and after the OperationFuture has returned,
   * the key itself is observed with the given durability options (watch
